Created this because didn't like the bland looks of current Wordpress github activity plugins.

Pretty simple to use:
  1. Upload via plugins tab and enable.
  2. Use shortcode [github-activity] where you would like it. Configurable options below.

Options:
  1. username="stopspazzing"
  2. repository="" // optional
  3. limit="20" // optional
