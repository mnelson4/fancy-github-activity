Requirements: Wordpress 4.5.x or above

Created this because didn't like the bland looks of current Wordpress Github activity plugins.

Pretty simple to use:
  1. Upload via plugins tab and enable.
  2. Use shortcode [fancy-github-activity] where you would like it. Configurable options below.

Options:
  * username="stopspazzing" // required
  * repository="" // optional
  * limit="20" // optional
