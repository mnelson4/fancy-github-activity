Credits: [caseyscarborough](https://github.com/caseyscarborough/github-activity) for his awesome github activity code. :heart:

Requirements: Wordpress 4.5 or above

Created this because didn't like the bland looks of current Wordpress Github activity plugins.

Pretty simple to use:
  1. Upload via plugins tab and enable.
  2. Use shortcode [fancy-github-activity] where you would like it. Configurable options below.

Options:
  1. username="stopspazzing" // required
  2. repository="" // optional
  3. limit="20" // optional

  Example:
  [fancy-github-activity username="stopspazzing"]
